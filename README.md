# General R6-Recoil-Compensation v1.01
&nbsp;

R6 Recoil Compensation Macro in Lua

&nbsp;

Instructions: enabled during ADS and firing (holding down RMB and clicking LMB)

&nbsp;

Compatible with LGS enabled mice, install by going into LGS > Scripting to save macro.

&nbsp;

Rigoriously tested from Operation Health through Operation Chimera. Reliable for most weapons, MoveMouseRelative values may be adjusted to user preference. Be sure to run LGS as administrator if it does not run. Still a WIP for new recoil patterns and shake reduction.
